        <p><i>The Beginning After The End follows the life of the late King Grey after his untimely and mysterious death. <br>
        Arthur Leywin, he seeks to correct his past mistakes in the vibrant new continent of Dicathen, a world of magic and<br>
        fantastical creatures. Equipped with the knowledge of a powerful king in his mid-thirties, Arthur navigates his new life<br>
        as the magic-wielding child of two retired adventurers and gains purpose through each of his new experiences—<br>
        something he lacked in his previous life. When a kind dragon sacrifices her life to protect him, Arthur resolves to live a<br>
        sincere, kind, and courageous life with those he loves. With the help of a lost elf princess and the Elven Kingdom of<br>
        Elenoir, Arthur begins his long journey to find his true place in the world.</i></p><br>
        <br>
        <p><i>As the years pass, Arthur becomes more and more comfortable in this world, positioning himself as a young, but<br>
        respected figure. However, deja-vu strikes as a war brews between Dicathen and the Vritra, a clan of banished deities<br>
        now ruling over a faraway continent. Arthur must rise as a leader, despite his fear of becoming the war-hardened<br>
        monster he once was in his past life. As the war rages on, Arthur discovers that he was not reborn to this world by<br>
        chance… nor was he the only one.</i></p><br>
